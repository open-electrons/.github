## Hi there 👋

You have reached the open-electrons organization page. This is an attempt to provice a reference implementation to the OCPP, OCPI and whatever protocol that the e-mobility industry might bring. In additional to that, the goal is to build the whole ecosystem around e-mobility, be it charging, payments, provisioning, smart contracts, flexibility services etc., etc.,.

I'm just startring out, if you are interested to collaborate, please feel free to drop me a message [here](https://github.com/orgs/open-electrons/discussions/1). Please also take a look at the [documentation](https://open-electrons.github.io/home/) for more information!
